As a Web Development student at CTU Training Solutions, I create and maintain user-friendly and responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have earned two IT Specialist certifications from Certiport, a leading provider of performance-based certification exams, in HTML and CSS, and JavaScript. These certifications demonstrate my proficiency and knowledge in the core technologies of web development. At CTU, I have learned various programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, and Bootstrap. I have been developing wed pages for the past year, and I have contributed to several projects for during my studies, such as developing an e-commerce website, a portfolio showcase, and a quiz app. I have enjoyed working with a diverse and collaborative team of students and instructors, and I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies. My core competencies include web development, problem solving, communication, and teamwork. My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and create innovative and impactful web solutions for various industries and audiences. I am now looking for an opportunity to enter the world of work and gain some experience.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
